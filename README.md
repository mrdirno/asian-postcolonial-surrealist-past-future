## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character uses a purchased 'memory' (grief, euphoria, homesickness) and experiences its unintended, surreal side-effects.
- Create a profile and first encounter for a 'runner' in the Glitch, detailing the contraband data-ghost or memory they are moving and why it's forbidden.
- Describe an artifact seized by the Ministry of Temporal Harmony from the perspective of the officer who must catalog and 'shelve' its dangerous resonance.
- Imagine a 'Dream Parlour' sanctioned by the state. What bland, controlled nostalgia do they sell, and what does a session there feel like versus Linh's stall?

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'memory distillation' apparatus for Linh's stall. What are its components (copper coils, ceramic bowls, specific herbs) and what is the step-by-step process to extract 'powdered grief' or 'distilled euphoria'?
- Map the Glitch. Create a visual or textual map of this surveillance-blind district, noting key landmarks (the cathedral of rust, specific data-dens, safe houses, the canal), and the routes runners use to navigate it.
